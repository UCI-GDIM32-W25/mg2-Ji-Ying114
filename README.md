## Devlog
I think that the plan I wrote in the plan really helps me construct the code structure, making it more organized. The plan guides the way the objects interacti with each other and divides the big goal, the final game we want, into small goals that can be completed little by little, so I can write the code more efficiently, with a clear sense of direction. For example, the public void IncreaseScore() method in controller is what we planned. I can use this method to update the game status in the player object directly so that I do not have to write or try writing codes in other classes. I think that controller itself is important because it manages the whole game, and building methods like IncreaseScore() in the controller makes the code more managable.
